<h1> Let's get acquainted! </h1>
<h2> I am Aidana Akibaeva, the sophmore of AMI department. </h2>
<p> I have been living for one year in Washington DC. It was great experience. I saw how developed this country is. And I understand that Kygyzstan can be in the same level in future. That's why I hope that I will be the one who'll make our country better. And this is the reason why I want to be the programmer. To make Kyrgyzstan known though the Internet.  </p>
